## Server Experiences üì¶

‚ö°Ô∏è **Elestra**\
Elestra was one of the first and biggest minehut plot generator servers in it's time, but was shut down due to issues with the management team.\
I worked as a support team member for a long period of time under the names of "Madelyn" and "Stephen".\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Woolgens**\
Woolgens was a pretty basic, but big minehut plot generator server, but was shut down due to requests and wishes from the owners.\
My time there isn't too much to brag about, but I still learned a lot from it, and it helped me to reach where I am today.\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **GoldenGN**\
GoldenGN was one of my first creation on minehut, but it was still a pretty big part of me, and helped me to pursue development and programming.\
The server was created the summer of 2021, but was sold off in late August-September.\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Stealable**\
Stealable was my first "big" creation, and I wouldn't be here today, without that server.\
It was created at the start of summer in 2022, and was one of the biggest raiding generator servers in it's prime.\
I developed this server mainly by myself, but had minor help of different friends across minehut.\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **Branding**\
Branding was my first network server. It started off as a normal plot generator server, but expanded into a network.\
This server was not just me though. I had a lot of help from my partner at the time, "MEXIO".\
The server was passed down to a friend of both of us, and has had a lot of remakes and rebranding since then.\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **CodGen**\
CodGen was the latest rebrand of Branding. \
It has ben transformed into a normal Generator/RPG server and is the one of my servers that has the biggest profit margins.\
This server was shut down, but had high profits, and a big community.\
\
‚ö°Ô∏è **BrawlMC**\
BrawlMc was the first server I joined just as a staff member after a really long time just owning servers. \
It started as a raid generator server then moved in to a network server with events and etc..\
I started as a helper, but moved to a manager only few days after first playing the server.\
BrawlMC has reached high peaks with over 1k members on discord and a great average player count.\

## Skript & Development Experiences üöÄ

- I started learning skript in 2020, because I wanted to make something myself, and not rely on others.
- It started simple with minehut tutorials, and a lot of errors later, I some what got the hang of it.
- I've now owned and developed plenty of servers, that has made very good profit margins.
