**ABOUT ME:**

Previous Experiences In Development & Moderation:

· Elestra
Elestra was one of the first and biggest minehut plot generator servers in it's time, but was shut down due to issues with the management team.
I worked as a support team member for a long period of time under the names of "Madelyn" and "Stephen".

· Woolgens
Woolgens was a pretty basic, but big minehut plot generator server, but was shut down due to requests and wishes from the owners.
My time there isn't too much to brag about, but I still learned a lot from it, and it helped me to reach where I am today.

· GoldenGN
GoldenGN was one of my first creation on minehut, but it was still a pretty big part of me, and helped me to pursue development and programming.
The server was created the summer of 2021, but was sold off in late August-September.

· Stealable
Stealable was my first "big" creation, and I wouldn't be here today, without that server.
It was created at the start of summer in 2022, and was one of the biggest raiding generator servers in it's prime.
I developed this server mainly by myself, but had minor help of different friends across minehut.

· Branding
Branding was my first network server. It started off as a normal plot generator server, but expanded into a network.
This server was not just me though. I had a lot of help from my partner at the time, "MEXIO".
The server was passed down to a friend of both of us, and has hada lot of remakes and rebranding since then, but is now known as "FISHLERS".
