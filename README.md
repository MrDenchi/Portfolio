**Previous Experiences In Development & Moderation:**

· **Elestra** - Elestra was one of the first and biggest minehut plot generator servers in it's time, but was shut down due to issues with the management team.
I worked as a support team member for a long period of time under the names of "Madelyn" and "Stephen".

· **Woolgens** - Woolgens was a pretty basic, but big minehut plot generator server, but was shut down due to requests and wishes from the owners.
My time there isn't too much to brag about, but I still learned a lot from it, and it helped me to reach where I am today.

· **GoldenGN** - GoldenGN was one of my first creation on minehut, but it was still a pretty big part of me, and helped me to pursue development and programming.
The server was created the summer of 2021, but was sold off in late August-September.

· **Stealable** - Stealable was my first "big" creation, and I wouldn't be here today, without that server.
It was created at the start of summer in 2022, and was one of the biggest raiding generator servers in it's prime.
I developed this server mainly by myself, but had minor help of different friends across minehut.

· **Branding** - Branding was my first network server. It started off as a normal plot generator server, but expanded into a network.
This server was not just me though. I had a lot of help from my partner at the time, "MEXIO".
The server was passed down to a friend of both of us, and has had a lot of remakes and rebranding since then, but is now known as "FISHLERS".
 
 

**History And Experience With Skript:**

I started learning skript back in late 2020. I was done with needing other people to skript for me, and I wanted to become independent.
It started simple with minehut tutorials, and a lot of errors, but it didn't take me long before I got the hang of it.
I have now owned and developed a lot of servers, and I'm still an active developer to this day.
